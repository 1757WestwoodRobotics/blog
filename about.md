Founded in 2006, we are a high-school robotics team from Westwood, MA with a mission to inspire young people to become leaders in science, technology, art, engineering, and mathematics by engaging them in team-based programs that build important technical and life skills such as leadership, innovation, communication, and self-confidence.

This is our blog for updates on our team.
