Volunteer mentors are crucial to the operation of our team and our success. Whether someone has little or a lot of technical experience with tools, programming experience, or business-related skills in areas such as finance, social media, or logistics, we invite you to join us for an introduction Wednesday evening 9/26 at 7 PM at the Westwood High School. *FIRST* is the worldwide high school student focused competition that centers around a different game each year with a six week build season starting at the beginning of January. This is a great way to connect with bright-minded high-schoolers and expand your network with other mentors. Attending this event is not required for mentoring.
