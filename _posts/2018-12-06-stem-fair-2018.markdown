On December 6th, Westwood High School held its first STEM fair in the faculty lounge thanks to the hard work of Robotics team captain Larry Tseng and Robotics Public Relations captain Daniel Xu. The science elective Anatomy and Physiology had a booth at the fair as well as the clubs: BioBuilders, Science team, Marine biology, and Robotics. During the fair Robotics showed off their robot from 2018, Marine Biology club displayed several specimens that they investigate and science team highlighted some victories from the current year. At the anatomy and physiology booth, spectating parents and students were even challenged to arrange a model a skeleton. The STEM fair was a complete success thanks to hard the work of the student volunteers and the curiosity of the perspective students and parents!
