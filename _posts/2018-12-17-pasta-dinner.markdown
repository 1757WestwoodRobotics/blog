The Westwood Robotics team held their first Pasta Dinner fundraiser complete with a raffle, a silent auction, a robotics presentation and of course, pasta! The dinner was catered by the Chateau complete with a variety of other dishes and snacks. The raffle was for a $15 J.P. Lick's gift card and the silent auction was for an iRobot vacuum cleaner, both generously donated. Many families, teachers and other members of the community attended the dinner to help the team raise money. Thank you to all of the attendees, parent helpers and volunteers for helping the night go so smoothly!
