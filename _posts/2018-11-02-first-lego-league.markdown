Westwood's three First Lego League teams took part in a scrimmage at the Middle School. The scrimmage had 4 parts, team building activities, presentation of invention ideas, presentation of their robots and a test run for the robots. Each team needed to come up with an invention idea that could solve a common problem for space exploration. The "Blockheads" team came up with a sticky belt for collecting floating trash in spaceships. The Flying Burritos team thought up a virtual reality environment to help with astronaut loneliness. Lastly, the Taikonauts team suggested a satellite that could collect trash in space. All teams performed wonderfully and are ready for the competition.
