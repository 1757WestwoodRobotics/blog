We are excited to hear about next year's *FIRST* robotics programs based on the theme of space! The Team is hoping to get really involved this year and base as much as we can around this new theme. However, unlike last season where 95% of the team were freshman, we intend to give teams a run for their money, and hopefully bring home the gold.
