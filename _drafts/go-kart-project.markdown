Because the Westwood Robotics Team has been done with competitions for a while, so we have been looking for a project to work on. For some extra practice with electronics, design, and programming, our team has decided to build a go-kart. The go-kart has two pneumatic wheels in the back, two omni wheels in the front for easy turning, and four CIM motors. It can support around 200 pounds, has a back and footrest, and is controlled by a flight stick in the standard arcade drive (one joystick for both forward/backwards and turning).
