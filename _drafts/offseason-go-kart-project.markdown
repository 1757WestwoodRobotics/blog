For some extra practice with electronics, design, and programming, our team decided to build a go-kart. The go-kart has two pneumatic wheels in the back, two omni wheels in the front for ease with turning, and four CIM motors. The go-kart can easily support around 200 pounds. The design has a back and foot rest, and is controlled by a flight stick in the standard arcade drive (one stick for both forward/backwards and turning).
