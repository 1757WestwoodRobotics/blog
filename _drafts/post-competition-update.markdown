Dear team and community,

Wow! What an exhilarating way to finish our matches at our UNH district event last weekend! Our robot, Rampothy, finished 21st out of 40 teams, and we were selected to compete in the quarterfinals where we made history successfully executing a challenging plan – one never seen before in the history of the FIRST Robotics Competition. Kudos to each drive team on our alliance!

The hard work and crucial contributions of every talented student and mentor on our team throughout the build and competition seasons have risen us to the top. Although we sacrificed our hatch mechanism midway through the event, we quickly adapted to our new game plan and devoted all our efforts toward our ramp feature, enticing the masses at the event and online.
