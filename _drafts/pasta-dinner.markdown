The Westwood Robotics Team held their first Pasta Dinner fundraiser complete with a raffle, a silent auction, a robotics presentation and of course, pasta! The dinner was catered by the chateau complete with a variety of dishes. The raffle was for a $15 J.P. Lick's gift card and the silent auction was for a cleaning irobot. Many families, teachers and other members of the community attended the dinner to help the team raise money. Thank you to all of the attendees, parent helpers and volunteers for helping the night go so smoothly.
