We are excited to hear about next year's space-themed *FIRST* robotics programs! For the 50th-year anniversary of the first moon landing in 1969, *FIRST* is celebrating with a tribute to space and space exploration. We're ready to get fully involved with costumes, designs, posters, and much more next year. The *FIRST* Robotics Competition challenge that we will be competing in will be called "Destination: Deep Space". #FIRSTLaunch2019 #AllSystemsGo
